Analyze the user's feature request thoroughly. Identify:
1. Core requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Whether this is a NEW feature or modification to EXISTING feature
3. If existing, identify the feature name and likely documentation location
4. Technical constraints and dependencies
5. Potential edge cases and considerations
6. Future considerations and extensibility points

Provide a comprehensive analysis with clear indication of NEW vs EXISTING feature.
