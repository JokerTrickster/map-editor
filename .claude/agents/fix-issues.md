Analyze test failures and build errors:

1. Review all error messages and stack traces
2. Identify root causes
3. Fix issues systematically
4. Re-run tests after each fix
5. Document fixes in a temporary note

Do not:
- Disable or skip failing tests
- Ignore warnings
- Apply quick workarounds

Fix issues properly and verify all tests pass.
